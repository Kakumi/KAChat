# KAChat
This plugin is a chat manager for minecraft. Avaible from spigot 1.7.10 to 1.16.5 (tested).
<br>You can create a channel and configure them quite easily to be able to create a lot of chats with permission, world restriction and range. Also, this plugin provides some security checker and formatter like [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/).
<br>You can use our API to create custom channels and be able to create your behaviour for every chat. You can almost change everything, and it was the goal of this plugin.
<br>**Actually, this plugin is in version 1.0 so feel free to suggest some ideas and report bugs.**

## Middleware
### Checkers
Checkers are used to be sure the message respect some restrictions otherwise the message will be blocked. These are the one offer by the plugin. They can be disabled in the config file.
1. **Anti-advertisement**: Blocks URLs and servers IP
1. **Bad words**:  Blocks words that are listed as bad
1. **Anti-capslock**:  Blocks messages with XX% capitalize letters
1. **Anti-spam**: Blocks repetitive messages (this functionalities can be a bit buggy because it makes some checks between each word, it is quite intelligent but need more tests to be sure it's working well)
1. **Chat protect**: Blocks messages that are strange to send (to avoid bot spam)
1. **Cooldown Message**: Blocks messages if there is a cooldown in the channel
1. **Min Size**: Blocks messages if the size is lower than the one set in the config file

### Formatters
Formatters are used to make changes on the sent message.
1. **Capitalize**: capitalize the first letter of the message
1. **Auto dot**: Add a dot at the end of the sentence

### Placeholders
Placeholders are used to replace some text in the message by some plugins values.
1. **KAChatAPI**:
    * {message}: The message sent by the player (real message)
    * {channel}: The player's channel prefix
    * {color}: The player's color (white)
    * {chat_color}: The player's channel color
    * {player}: The player's name
    * _More will be added soon._
2. **PlaceholderAPI**:
    * [List of placeholders](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders)
    * Be sure to download the extension you need by doing the command : /papi ecloud download <Extension>
    
## API
### How to use the API
First you need to install the dependency through .jar file, Maven or Gradle.
<br>Maven : _Coming soon_
<br>Gradle: _Coming soon_

Then, you can use the plugin:
```java
public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        if (Bukkit.getPluginManager().getPlugin("KAChat") != null) {
            //Access the API through KAChatAPI.getInstance()
            KAChatAPI.getInstance().getChannels().size();
        } else {
            //Plugin doesn't exist
            getPluginLoader().disablePlugin(this);
        }
    }
}
```
### What can you do ?
- Create custom channels and register them
- Change how to select players available to receive the message
- Change how to send the message
- Change the behaviour to select the player's color
- Change the behaviour to select the chat color
- Change how to save messages in the log file (disabled by default but working)
- Add or remove checkers, formatters and placeholders
- Retrieve information such as player's channel, player's last message, default format, default channel, ...

All methods are documented so know how to use then.

### Examples
#### Checker
```java
public class MyChecker implements Checker {
    public boolean valid(Player player, String message) throws CheckerException {
        if (message.contains("test")) throw new SecurityTestException();
        return true;
    }

    //Should be false for you, if true, this checker will be removed after KAChat reload.
    public boolean delete() {
        return false;
    }
}

public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        KAChatAPI.getInstance().getCheckers().add(new MyChecker());
    }
}
```

#### Message formatter
```java
public class MyFormatter implements Formatter {
    public String format(Player player, String message) {
        return message.replace("m", "k");
    }

    //Should be false for you, if true, this formatter will be removed after KAChat reload.
    public boolean delete() {
        return false;
    }
}

public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        KAChatAPI.getInstance().getMessageFormatters().add(new MyFormatter());
    }
}
```

#### Placeholder
```java
public class MyPlaceholder implements Placeholder {
    public String format(Player player, String message) {
        return message.replace("{placeholder}", player.getName());
    }
}

public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        KAChatAPI.getInstance().getPlaceholders().add(new MyPlaceholder());
    }
}
```

#### ChatManager
```java
public class CustomChatManager extends ChatManager {
    @Override
    public String getPlayerColor(Player player) {
        if (player.hasPermission("op")) {
            return "ยง4";
        }

        return super.getPlayerColor(player);
    }
}

public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        KAChatAPI.getInstance().setChatManager(new CustomChatManager());
    }
}
```

#### Custom Events
```java
public class CustomListener extends Event {
    @EventHandler
    public void onChannelReceiveMessage(ChannelReceiveMessageEvent event) {
